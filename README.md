# pub-age-eligibility-checker-v.01
A simple Python program that checks if a user is old enough to enter a pub. It takes the userâ€™s name and age, validates the input, and displays eligibility. If eligible, the user can choose to proceed or exit; otherwise, it shows how many years remain. Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and error handling.
