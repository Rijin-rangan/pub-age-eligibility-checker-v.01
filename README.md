##Pub Eligibility Checker

#This Python program is a simple yet interactive **age verification system** designed to determine if a user is eligible to enter a pub based on a defined minimum age requirement. It simulates a real-world user interaction scenario while showcasing core programming concepts like **loops**, **conditional logic**, and **exception handling** in Python.

### ðŸ§¾ **Project Description**

The script begins by printing a welcoming message and defining the minimum required age (set to 18). It then prompts the user to input their **name** and **age**. To ensure reliability, the program uses a `try-except` block to handle invalid age inputs, preventing runtime errors if a user mistakenly enters non-numeric values. Once valid data is entered, it displays the combined user details in a neat formatted output.

After validating the input, the program checks whether the user meets the minimum age requirement. If the userâ€™s age is greater than or equal to 18, they receive a confirmation message that they are allowed to enter the pub. If not, the program politely informs them how many more years they must wait before becoming eligible.

For users who are eligible, the program adds an additional interactive section where they can choose to either **proceed** or **exit**. The input options are clearly displayed:

* Press `1` to proceed
* Press `0` to exit

The program continuously validates user input to ensure only valid responses are accepted. Invalid entries trigger appropriate error messages, maintaining a smooth user experience. Upon selecting an option, a corresponding message is displayed â€” either thanking the user for proceeding or wishing them goodbye.

In conclusion, this program serves as an excellent example of **basic user interaction**, **input validation**, and **decision-making** in Python. Itâ€™s beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and provides a fun, real-life inspired coding exercise to strengthen programming fundamentals while improving logical thinking and user interface design in console applications.
